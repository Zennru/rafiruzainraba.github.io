                <p>Hello, my name is Rafi Ruzain Raba. I'm a third-semester computer science student at Jakarta State University. 
                    I'm the second of three children and enjoy exploring nature and researching my surroundings. I enjoy studying English and am interested in Japanese.

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Self reflection</h2>
            <p>In this digital era, I'm often curious about many things and want to learn more about them, 
                whether through experiences in nature or in college. 
                From there, I've become accustomed to thinking more openly and critically, and I've cultivated a spirit of perseverance. 
                With gradual effort, personal growth can be achieved</p>

            <h2>Future career goals</h2>
            <p>Seeing the increasingly sophisticated era, I hope to become a professional in the technology field who is not only skilled in material but also technically. 
                Although it can be said that nowadays more and more people are skilled in technology, 
                I hope to create innovation by combining my hobbies with technology to create a unique and useful innovation that is sustainable</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">College Resume</h2>
            <p>During my studies at Jakarta State University (UNJ), I learned a lot, especially programming languages. 
                From studying at UNJ, I learned that there is a programming language, namely DLang. A very complex language to learn, then there is Python which is useful to this day, C++ for studying data and now there is HTML and CSS. 
                Although HTML and CSS are not included in programming languages, but these two are very often used for website purposes and other things. 
                In PPW lectures from the first meeting to the third meeting, I learned a lot about HTML and CSS for my future portfolio activities</p>
